# GameAlert (working title)

GameAlert will be a set of devices used to alert members of a group to something. In our use case, our gaming group will be using them to alert one another when we're online and ready/wanting to play a game.

### What about SMS?
This is how we are currently solving the problem. While this is an easy enough solution, GameAlert will potentially make it much simiplier to notify group members. 

With SMS, you have to unlock your phone, open the app launcher, find the messaging app, back out of the active thread, find the group thread, and then compose and send your message.

With GameAlert, the device sits next to the console or PC, and you push a button. The other members of the group are notified on their decives via an LED that corresponds to you. And that's it.
